# CS305

Artemis Financial needed help securing their software to protect sensitive data and keep client-server communications safe. They had issues like hardcoded credentials, outdated libraries, and lack of input validation, which could lead to data breaches and other security problems. I found and fixed these by adding RSA encryption with SHA-256 hashing, setting up HTTPS, and running the OWASP Dependency-Check to catch any weak points.

The vulnerability assessment was challenging but important to spot risks. To make sure everything worked and stayed secure, I tested the refactored code to ensure no new issues popped up. Moving forward, Iâ€™d use these tools and best practices, like input validation and avoiding hardcoded credentials, to keep software safe. This project gave me useful skills in secure coding that I can show future employers.
